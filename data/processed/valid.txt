a guide to preview deployments with serverless ci/cd $@$ guide ill explain framework pro preview deployment might want take advantage show enable application ill use version song vote counting service created called serverless jam help illustrate follow along step step preview deployment might familiar concept preview deployment frontend tooling like netlify allow create preview frontend build merged production website well serverless thought dont backends past answer question simple cost much day expensive sprawling backend infrastructure took far much money developer time replicate environment effectively testing staging let alone every pr serverless application managed service microservice architecture thats longer case take typical aws microservice serverless framework resource included probably lambda function api gateway endpoint dynamodb table sqs queue sn topic bucket ssm parameter characteristic resource share theyre virtually payasyougo payperuseinvocation style service configured cheaply mean create entire separate stack infrastructure every feature branch without spending much use preview deployment preview deployment benefit frontend code clearly apparent get preview url deployment see changed make sure look great really get something similar backend let take look automated test create preview deployment framework pro cicd system still run automated test setup run deployment give benefit might otherwise waited staging environment check supplement existing cicd use preview deployment combination serverless cicd stage like production staging use addition whatever existing cicd tool already using another tool workflow great still add preview deployment without disrupting existing process clean environment code review youre spinning entire set infrastructure open season code reviewer play api endpoint infrastructure resource run manual test confirm deployment meet expectation run api contract test api endpoint created integrate feature branch local frontends fuller test experience especially helpful want validation frontend team expected functionality new api preview branch discrete environment dont worry stepping toe review go straight back pr make sure issue feedback discover addressed pr even merged staging environment automated spin spin resource spun automatically opening pr there manual process developer reviewer create full environment test best part pr finally closed merged configure deployment automatically remove infrastructure resource created aws use preview deployment configure section ill take get started preview deployment youll able follow along every step cloning serverless preview deployment project using framework pro account prerequisite order get started preview deployment youll need framework pro account get free account personal use configure using step post preview deployment require code github deploying service aws using either node python using recent version serverless framework im using v perquisite met able configure repository use preview deployment setting preview deployment first youll need follow step get cicd working framework pro account step documented let walk together setup default provider using preview deployment well deploying stage name based feature branch name help avoid conflict resource name feature branch name unique able work environment multiple aws account want make sure use appropriate nonproduction account usually deployment preview branch preview branch could created time potential stage name opportunity select correct aws connection associate automatically generated stage however add provider framework pro account even set provider default default account used preview deployment fact deployment stage name yet manually configured adding provider super simple two minute youtube walk setting connection get github repo setup example ill use version serverless jam vote counting system different codingrelated song well open feature branch pr add functionality serverless jam create github repo go ahead sign github take moment create new github repository make public private give memorable name well find later ill call mine previewdeploymentstest screenshot new repo creation page github copy git url repo later mine httpsgithubcomfernandomcpreviewdeploymentstestgit need step well need repository github account push code configure preview deployment later create repo clone code well using run git clone httpsgithubcomfernandomcserverlesspreviewdeploymentsgit get code enter project directory cd serverlesspreviewdeployments change git origin git remote seturl origin example mine would git remote seturl origin gitgithubcomfernandomcpreviewdeploymentstestgit confirm youve correctly updated remote url git remote v run git push origin master push code repo im jumping hoop make sure repo alone associated mine way way make sure dont inadvertently open feature request repo unfortunately fail repo setup need create configure app framework pro configuring app framework pro navigate framework pro dashboard click create app button go ahead give app name required box add service name serverlessyml serverlessjams havent changed clicking deploy give opportunity choose aws provider default app leave blank see command copy paste org app property serverlessyml make sure run serverless login havent yet serverless framework cli tool access serverless pro account run deploy initial deployment way make lot easier edit cicd setting clicking menu left deployed service name go setting option go cicd setting option connect github bitbucket click whichever appropriate screenshot connecting github multiple organization associated account youll need pick one put repo screenshot selecting org user account github least need grant permission access repo created screenshot selecting repository github point might also another screen two prompting install serverless application github youre done process head back framework pro dashboard see repo dropdown pick screenshot connecting repo framework pro dashboard select repo using preview deployment configured default shown screenshot preview deployment setting could also configure deployment branch like whenever change made master save setting continue testing preview deployment example well master branch github repository pr made master branch feature branch well want create preview deployment pr set go back code run git checkout b previewtestfeature create new feature branch backendvotepy file change integer line u vote instead add push change run git add add change commit change git commit vote finally push feature branch origin git push origin previewtestfeature output include something like see click link automatically open pr otherwise visit repo github open pr manually screenshot open pull request button actually open pr screenshot pull request creation page open pr see github check running pr like screenshot preview check run github serverless see failure like click detail screenshot failed build github direct deployment section framework pro dashboard review log preview deployment see happened screenshot failed build log framework pro everything successful see success message github screenshot successful preview deployment github clicking detail link inside serverless check direct framework pro dashboard review log build finally deployment completed youll see api endpoint relevant resource created point reviewer could copy paste api endpoint test reviewing could test new api using something like postman even copy api endpoint directly frontend test within ui let give shot fun copy base api endpoint log case httpsmyjahkkexecuteapiuseastamazonawscompreviewtestfeature paste frontendappjs file replaceme value currently line becomes new endpointurlroot change directory frontend repository run python httpserver start webserver frontend open localhost look something like screenshot frontend application try using app make sure enter number plus sign country code beginning submit vote youll see incremented instead could keep testing api endpoint go comment pr suggest change needed made done either merge pr close point also selfcleaning branch merged deleted serverless cicd automatically remove service bear mind delete branch close pr infrastructure removed next hope ive convinced utility possibility preview deployment next try taking look feature serverless cicd like branch deployment testing suggestion want serverless cicd next let u know comment

container image support for aws lambda $@$ aws lambda easy use manage execution environment specific runtime known environment send code run nice served u well year biggest problem status quo however want achieve use case outside predetermined environment perhaps want perform form processing using library included default lambda environment even use runtime provided aws tried help solve issue introduction lambda layer useful still quite limited real problem lambda default great pick run little maintenance flexibility sacrificed achieve simplicity december released basic docker container support recently expanded make lot easier user make use new feature container entirely encapsulates lambda function library handler code o runtime etc need point event trigger serverless framework make incredibly easy pointing existing container definition contains everything lambda need execute including handler code entire packaging process occurs context container aws us docker configuration build optimise prepare container use lambda bear mind isnt proprietary k background still much lambda microvm architecture container wholly custom packaged way prepare optimise use environment like regular lambda aws claim cold start time see significant impact think safe assume possible configure thing way make cold start longer taking care testing thoroughly may needed especially since container image gb size seen package size affect cold start time past brings biggest downside using docker container new feature definitely needed provide great amount flexibility platform serverless development general really seen last resort one great selling point serverless development spit solution underlying managed service manage everything infrastructure network os runtimes docker support ratchet back notch take back management o runtimes may required situation use prebuilt prepared environment still advisable reduce amount work may need managing environment one reason u started building application serverless begin let framework heavy lifting would like make use docker support still allow framework lot work covered recently added ability define dockerfile point serverlessyml serverless framework work making sure container available ecr setup configured needed lambda one prerequisite get started need make sure docker cli installed local machine grab instruction environment docker documentation get ball rolling let use added starter template make thing little easier serverless create template awsnodejsdocker path awsnodejsdockerdemo generate boilerplate basic setup already configured u serverlessyml let go take look key section provider section see something new tell framework image reference name appimage use elsewhere configuration content docker image resides path property dockerfile type reside specified folder dockerfile work specifying executable code function dockerfile publicecrawslambdanodejs copy appjs overwrite command serverlessyml template cmd apphandler cmd property defines file called appjs function called handler look content service directory file called appjs inside exact function name good far however still need configure function created lambda event trigger note use value imagename image defined appimage anything want long use value reference also attach event need containerbased version work like noncontainer version tada reusing container multiple function sometimes may actually want use function container multiple function defined serverlessyml store function handler single container reference individually within serverlessyml effectively overwriting cmd property need adding command property telling framework specific function code still appjs file function name greeter also entrypoint property related base image reference dockerfile taking look first line dockerfile base image container built one aws use base image always use different base image dockerfile sure use correct entrypoint value thats able generate container deploy ecr execute function however want centralise creation docker image outside serverless framework reference serverlessyml capability available building docker container manually lambda build docker container ahead time specifically lambda reference serverlessyml start let get small list requirement way ensure docker cli installed httpsdocsdockercomgetdocker ensure aws cli installed httpsdocsawsamazoncomclilatestuserguideclichapinstallhtml need use docker prepare docker container aws cli push newly minted container awss ecr service use lambda case following step login docker aws ecr substitute right region account id needed see message login succeeded setup lambda ready docker image easiest way rely base image provided aws check aws ecr gallery list available image pull chosen image via e g nodejs image time writing post pulled basic configuration image follows build image create repository corresponding lambda image aws ecr service create repository command image specific store version suggest naming repository image link local image aws ecr repository push note returned image digest need reference image service configuration point lambda aws ecr image finally serverlessyml point lambda pushed image referencing uri digest returned last docker push command thats pretty easy get docker container running lambda environment question around using
